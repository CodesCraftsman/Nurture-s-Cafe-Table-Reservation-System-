    <h3 class="mb-0">OUR EVALUATION</h3><hr>
                <p class="mb-auto">Our fixed price ‘all you can eat’ concept at our Red Chilli Restaurants offers our customers a varying spread of consistently delicious food at a value-oriented price in a pleasant and casual dining environment. We believe that barbeque cuisine is distinctively attractive as compared with other dining options due to its DIY and cooked-at-the-table nature and the flexibility and fun of mixing and matching a wide variety of meats, vegetables, sauces and condiments to create dishes according to each diner’s individual tastes and preferences. In addition, fixed price dining is very popular amongst relatively larger groups, due to customers’ perception of value for money and the comfort of certainty over the bill amount irrespective of varying individual appetites and consumption

                    Our Red Chilli Restaurants typically offer customers at least five vegetarian and five non-vegetarian largely pre-cooked appetisers they can season and barbeque on a grill embedded in their table, an all-you-can-eat main course buffet and a selection of desserts.
                    
                    Our core values prioritise being customer-focused to provide excellent products and service and employee-focused by maintaining a superior quality work environment. Our Company was ranked 7th among best companies to work for in India across all categories by Economic Times “Great Places to Work” survey for 2022 conducted by Great Places to Work Institute. Our Company was the only company in the retail sector to be ranked amongst the top-10 and 13th among best large workplaces in Asia by Great places to Work Institute.

                <p>Multiple factors contribute to food satisfaction when consumers eat out. Among such factorsare satiation, sensory experience, and food quality, knowledge about the food including nutritionalvalue and origin, healthiness, visual attractiveness, freshness, price/value, promotion, social company,and variety/innovations [17–27]. The food quality is the most important factor in determining customersatisfaction and behavioral intention [28–30]. There are a number of other restaurant service attributesthat affect customer satisfaction: food presentation, tasty food, spatial seating arrangement, fascinatinginterior design, pleasing background music and mood, reliable service, and service responsiveness. Many ofthem are important in contributing to the satisfaction of a restaurant’s meals [31,32]. Some authorssuggested [33] that physical environment is important in increasing customer satisfaction and influencingrestaurant selection by consumers. The numerous environmental factors affecting food consumptioninclude odor, color, physical surroundings, and the effect of lighting [34,35]. The importance of each factorcan vary between persons. The consumer, currently choosing a catering establishment, pays attention tomany elements of food service that have not been taken into account previously.More attention is being paid to consumers’ awareness and their public self-consciousness inthe context of the satisfaction resulting from eating out [15,36]. For example, sustainable consumption,involving a reasonable use of consumer goods in an attempt to balance the global ecosystem with thefuture generations and the planet’s survival in mind. In the last decade, launching sustainable productionand consumption has become a major priority of the EU. Food service providers have started recognizingthe important role they play in managing the negative environmental impacts associated with theiroperations [37]. There are several negative environmental impacts, such as excessive energy consumptionassociated with carbon footprint build-up [38], 30% of global greenhouse gases, emissions [17,39],and contribution to food waste [40]. Along with this interest, both of consumers and restaurant owners,new trends are developing, such as trends in organic food consumption, environmental and sustainablepractices, green consumerism and green restaurants, promoting local foods, and organic foods andlow-carbon foods [25,41,42]. The growing interest of the population in a healthy life is a constant ofmodern society. The culinary habits are essential elements in this respect. Different studies [43–45]suggests that contemporary catering consumers have become more demanding in terms of their foodchoices at restaurants. According to them, consumers focus more on the food origin, what ingredients itcontains and what impacts it imposes on customer health, the well-being of local communities, and theenvironment, and select food based on its environmental credentials and ethical values.However, there is only a small amount of data on how customers evaluate sustainable practices inthe restaurant, in which they eat meals. The previous research on pro-environmental consumer choicein food service provision has predominantly documented consumer intensions rather than capturedthe actual consumer behavioral patterns [46]. Environmental factors have also been investigated,

<h1>NOW WE ARE</h1>
<P>Modern artists had one thing in common—they wanted to steer clear of the classic; from the mundane and accepted. It began with a personal urge for self-exploration that redefined set approaches. In that sense, the representation of Indian cuisine overseas has also gone through its interpretive phases, with chefs taking outrageous steps to give the cuisine a makeover. 

    Chef Saini’s pet project, four-year-old Tres Ind Studio in Dubai, won its first Michelin Star and got a ranking of four on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in the Middle East and North Africa this year. Tres Ind, the restaurant, was number 18 on the same list. Saini, who began his career with Chef Manish Mehrotra at Delhi’s celebrated Indian Accent, has come a full circle, but only after shedding  his modern, post-modern and progressive approach to Indian cuisine. He even  goes so far as to say that there is no such thing as modern Indian food. 
    <br><br>
    <br> Edited excerpts from an interview:
    <br><br>
   <br><b> What is the relevance of modern Indian food today?</b><br>
    In the last four years, we’ve developed a fresh philosophy around our cuisine. I spent 2021 travelling through Europe, giving talks and addressing people. Indian food is so layered that people outside of India find it complex. At one conference, I asked the audience to name five Indian dishes, and they couldn’t. What is the point of cooking modern food, when foreigners don’t get basic Indian food? We have restaurants such as Gaggan that have given Indian food a spin, but there is not enough market for understanding it. As Indians are evolving, so is our food. Today, I can say with confidence that the word ‘modern’ doesn’t exist. Instead, I call it ‘evolved’ Indian food.
    <br><br>
   <b> What brought about this change?</b>
    <br> When I started, I was in a very different space. The lockdown has given everyone wisdom and the time to reflect, think, and start over. My time with international chefs through collaborations and cookouts is what stirred this change; I spent time and cooked with mastermind chefs. Everyone was willing to work since Dubai had opened up [post the COVID-19 pandemic]. It was not about learning a recipe from them. If I can pick one per cent of their brains, it gives me a new in-road into my cooking. I had the pleasure to cook with Slovenian chef Ana Ros, Chef Jorge Vallejo and Torno Subito’s Chef de Cuisine, and a protégé of Massimo Bottura, Chef Bernardo Paladini. </P>

    <br><br>
    <p><b>How have you refined or redefined your food?</b>
        <br> I dropped all premium ingredients and focussed on accentuating Indian spices. European and Japanese food has one central animal protein; the vegetables are side dishes that accompany it. I reversed this. For example, one dish at the Studio is a corn curry with charred lobster tail. I tell my guests that the star of the dish is the corn. It has undergone three hours of cooking, and hence cannot be charred. So, the burnt lobster tail plays that role. Another is a crab ghee roast which we bake in Sri Lankan cinnamon bark. All the flavours of the cinnamon are absorbed by the dish. Here too, the spices are the star, not the crab. 
        <br><br>
       <br><b> Where are you now, mentally?</b><br>
        It may have begun with reinterpreting classic dishes, but my conscious effort is to create new dishes—new classics. The meetha achaar pork ribs at The Indian Accent or the blue cheese naan are new classics. The [old] classics have their place. I may make a dish that includes a little bit of various south Indian eats but the combination, proportion of spice used, and the pickle makes it stand out. How does a dish become classic? When it is fed to enough people. Sometimes, in a bid to stand out, we try to constantly change. But Massimo Bottura told me, that people don’t get it at one shot. Pick five dishes and serve them a zillion times. One day, someone will recognise [their quality] and your life will change. For me, I don’t call my dishes signature; that implies a dead end. If I want to create a new classic, I will serve it till someone takes notice (smiles).
