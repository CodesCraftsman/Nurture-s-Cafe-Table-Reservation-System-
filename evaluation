    <h3 class="mb-0">OUR EVALUATION</h3><hr>
                <p class="mb-auto">Our fixed price ‘all you can eat’ concept at our Barbeque Nation Restaurants offers our customers a varying spread of consistently delicious food at a value-oriented price in a pleasant and casual dining environment. We believe that barbeque cuisine is distinctively attractive as compared with other dining options due to its DIY and cooked-at-the-table nature and the flexibility and fun of mixing and matching a wide variety of meats, vegetables, sauces and condiments to create dishes according to each diner’s individual tastes and preferences. In addition, fixed price dining is very popular amongst relatively larger groups, due to customers’ perception of value for money and the comfort of certainty over the bill amount irrespective of varying individual appetites and consumption

                    Our Barbeque Nation Restaurants typically offer customers at least five vegetarian and five non-vegetarian largely pre-cooked appetisers they can season and barbeque on a grill embedded in their table, an all-you-can-eat main course buffet and a selection of desserts.
                    
                    Our core values prioritise being customer-focused to provide excellent products and service and employee-focused by maintaining a superior quality work environment. Our Company was ranked 7th among best companies to work for in India across all categories by Economic Times “Great Places to Work” survey for 2022 conducted by Great Places to Work Institute. Our Company was the only company in the retail sector to be ranked amongst the top-10 and 13th among best large workplaces in Asia by Great places to Work Institute.
